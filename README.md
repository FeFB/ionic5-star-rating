# Ionic 5 Star Rating

This library was forked from https://github.com/melwinVincent/ionic4-star-rating for a test of Ionic 5.

## Install

Run `npm install --save https://github.com/JeongJun-Lee/ionic5-star-rating/tarball/master`

## How to use

Same as https://github.com/melwinVincent/ionic4-star-rating/blob/master/README.md

But, there is only one change. Use this selector `ionic5-star-rating` in HTML template.
